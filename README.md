**Overview**
The Big Mart Sales Prediction aims to build a predictive model that can accurately forecast sales of different products in Big Mart stores. The goal is to help the company understand which products are likely to sell well in different locations, so that they can optimize their inventory and maximize profits.

**Data**
The project will use a dataset that contains information about 1559 products sold at 10 different locations. The dataset includes various attributes of each product such as its weight, visibility, price etc., as well as attributes of each store such as its size, location, etc. the dataset also includes the sales data for each product in each store.

**Methodology**
The Project involved the following steps:

1. **Data cleaning and preparation**
   The dataset will be cleaned to remove missing values and outliers, and the data will be prepared for analysis.

3. **Exploratory data Analysis (EDA)**
   EDA will be conducted to gain insights into the dataset and identify patterns and relationships between the various attributes.
   
5. **Feature Engineering**
   New features will be created from the existing dataset, such as the store's age, the price of the product per unit weight, etc.
   
7. **Model Selection**
   Different machine learning models will be tested and evaluated to determine which one is best suited for the task of sales prediction. Some of the models that may be used      include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.
   
9. **Model training and validation**
   The selected model will be trained on the dataset and validated using a holdout set of data to evaluate its performance.
   
11. **Model optimization**
    The model will be optimized by tuning its hyperparameters to improve its performance.
    Final model evaluation: The final model will be evaluated on atest set of data to determine its accuracy and its ability to predict sales for new products and stores.

**Conclusion**
The Big Mart Sales Prediction project aims to help Big Mart stores optimize their inventory and maximize profits by accurately predicting sales of different products in different locations. By using machine learning techniques and analyzing the provided dataset, the project can help big mart stores forecast sales and make informed business decisions.
